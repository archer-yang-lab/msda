\description{
These two datasets are subset of the dataset available on Gene Expression Omnibus with the accession number GDS1615. The original dataset contains 22283 gene expression levels and the disease states of the observed subjects. In Mai, Yang and Zou, the dimension of the original dataset was first reduced to 127 by F-test screening and then randomly split into training sets and testing sets. The two datasets GDS1615.train and GDS1615.test are the result of one such split.
